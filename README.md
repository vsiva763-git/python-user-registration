### Python User Registration System
# Overview
This project is a complete, self-contained user registration system written in Python. It's designed to validate user input for a sign-up form, ensuring that the name, email, and password meet specific security and formatting criteria before an account is created. The script includes robust error handling to provide clear feedback when validation fails.

# Features
Name Validation: Ensures the name is a string and is longer than two characters.

Email Validation: Checks for a valid email format, including a username, an @ symbol, and an approved top-level domain (e.g., .com, .org, .edu).

Password Strength Validation: Enforces a strong password policy, requiring a minimum length of 8 characters, at least one capital letter, and at least one number.

Error Handling: Uses try...except blocks to catch validation errors and return user-friendly messages.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries are required to run this script.

# How to Use
To use the script, save it as user_registration.py and run it directly from your terminal to see the example outputs.

# To run the examples in the script:
python user_registration.py

You can also import the register_user function into another Python file for use in a larger application.

from user_registration import register_user

# This will succeed
successful_user = register_user("YourName", "you@example.com", "AStrongPassword1")

# This will fail and print an error message
failed_user = register_user("Me", "invalid-email", "weak")

# Key Concepts Demonstrated
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of several core Python concepts:

Python Programming Fundamentals

Modular Function Design

Data Validation and Sanitization

Error and Exception Handling (try...except, raise ValueError)

String Manipulation

Control Flow (if/else, loops)
